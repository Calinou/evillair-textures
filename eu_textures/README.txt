[Description]
Dirty Sci-fi tech base style textures.

=============================================================================================
[Instructions]
Some textures may have multiple textures in one, just map the section you want.
You may need to create your own shader files depending on the engine you are using.

[Thanks]
Everyone who had kind words to say about my other sets.

Everyone who has used/will use my textures in their maps.
This is why I make them. :)
